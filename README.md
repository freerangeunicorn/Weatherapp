Week 5 - Homework - Weather 🌦️⛅☀️

Introduction 

This weather app 📱 was built with [ReactJS]. The app will display the weather forecast of your current location as well as 8 different locations around the world.

Features 🎯🥇🏆

- [x] User is prompted to give permission for our app to use their location if they haven't already given us permission.
- [x] User can see a locations fahrenheit & celsius temperature as well as a descripion.
- [x] User can see an icon appropriate for the type of their weather in a location.
- [x] User can see buttons which allow them to see weather of different cities.
- [x] User can see a randomly generated image of that city.

 Learning Objectives ✍️📚📝

1. Learn how to [fetch()](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data) data from an API.

   - Recognize data fetching **takes time**.
   - `fetch()` - Used to make requests to API.
     - The **1st** argument is the [api endpoint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2122604/what-is-an-endpoint) we're fetching data from.
   - `json()` - Used to **parse to JS** object.

2. Learn what `async` & `await` are used for. [Read more detailed async & await](https://alligator.io/js/async-functions/).

   - Recognize they're used to make asynchronous.
     - `async` - Tells JS that a function is **asynchronous**.
     - `await` - Tells JS that this line will **take a few moments**.


Review 💻🤓🤔

- Defining a large component to a few smaller components to handle some of the logic in our app makes our code easier to read and understand.
- Hardcoding data doesn't make us bad developers.

### Accomplishments 🥇🏆💯
